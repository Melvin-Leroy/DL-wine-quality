# DL-wine-quality

## Description

This project was about hyper-parameter tuning.

At first, I created a little neural network to try to classify the quality of different wines.

You can find these data [here](./data/wine.csv).

I used [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) to create this neural network.

## Installation

Just run this line in your terminal :

` conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt `

## Usage

You can try my first neural network in the [jupyter notebook](./notebooks/algorithm.ipynb)

For [wine_algorithm.py](./python_files/wine_algorithm.py), unfortunetaly, work is still in progress.
